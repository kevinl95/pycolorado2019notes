# WhyPy? Understanding Trends Driving the Usage of Python

### Developers Have Unprecedented Influence
Fueled by FOSS, Cloud. Ease of 'procurement', or lack therof
Collaboration tools- Git, slack, StackOverflow
Technology adoption is increasingly bottom up.

### Language Choice
Python, PHP, JavaScript, and other popular languages have a strong correlation of discussion and useage online

### What Python has going for It
- Extensibility
- Libraries
- General Purpose - traction in web design, scripting, data science, etc.
- Mastery - minimalist philosophy. 'Cleverness' is not viewed in a positive light. Makes it easier to achieve mastery
- Readibility
- Flow State - can code in fewer steps, get done faster
- Approachable learning curve
- Choice - because it is so general purpose there is a lot of choice in methodology and approach.
- Community - strong and positive developer community. Not very hostile to newcomers and new approaches.

### Why not Python?
- Extensibility is actually a problem sometimes: the best tech doesn't always win. 
- Composability vs complexity: Python is very composable so there are cases where things become overly complex.
- Mastery: Installation of the language can be tricky. Getting through the first steps can be tricky.
- Minimum time to dopamine: dependency management feels very fiddly and slow. Can take too long to get excited about what you're working on.
- Efficiency: Python is natoriously not very fast, resource efficient, or good at memory management. The gap is getting smaller with compiled languages over time, but Python was not developed in an era of multithreading. 
- Static typing resurgence: this is a new trend across the industry. Go, typescript, and rust are gaining traction. Type safety can make it faster to find bugs. This is one reason this is getting grafted onto Python.
- Upgrade path: The Python 2.7 -> 3 upgrade path has been too painful and lacks backwards compatibility.

### Alternative Languages
#### R
Very entrenched in academia. Stat courses tend to use it instead of Python. More libraries are ported from R to Python than the reverse. People want R functionality in Python.
#### TypeScript
Compatible with JavaScript, optional type checking. ((Aside from me: Python has optional type checking!!! Check out MyPy for example))
#### Go
A lot of the dependency management issues of Python and also some concerns about independence from Google.

### Community
There was concern about Guido stepping down. Some concern about the future direction of Python in the industry.
