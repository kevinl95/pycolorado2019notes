### Dash Overview
Library for Plotly
Written on top of flask, plotly.js, react.js
Allows for creation of rich, interactive web applications written in Python

### Arizona Vortex Dashboard

### Potential Applications
Excellent capabilities for displaying live data, even from machine learning according to Plot.ly. He was using it to display voltage output from sensors in real time. Quick example I found: https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps/tree/master/apps/dash-object-detection

### Takeaways
- Figure out what your audience actually wants
- Provide details and examples of potential capabilities during planning. Generates new ideas and directions. For example, show them the example gallery for the library of your choice
- Start simple
- Don't overpromise
- Communicate and collect feedback throughout

### Questions
Did you have to fight the web development side of things even though you were writing Python? Answer: No
Using this on a serverless platform like AWS Lambda? A: Speaker was not sure, thought it was possible.
Is it possible to embed a Dash app in an existing website? A: Speaker believes it has to run stand-alone.
Was the real-time dashboard the speaker created designed to be used in the field or in the lab? A: Eventually it will be used in field testing. Going to add wireless capabilities.
