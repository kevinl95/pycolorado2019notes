### Overview
Problems with gender disparity, legacy codebases, non-inclusion of junior devs, open-source burnout. No one weird trick so solve.

Being a good developer does not need to be a 'lone wolf' or anti-social.

### Empathy for developers
Primarily cognitive- put yourself in someone elses shoes when you look at someone elses code.
Consider how code makes you feel
Complicated code can make you feel inadequate

### Generic Tips for building empathy
- Be curious about strangers
- Listen actively and be open
- Expand your circle of empathy - beyond friends and teammates

### Imaginary people can help
UI and UX devs use personas to create imaginary people who use their stuff.
Imagine people you might work with
Need to recognize domains of expertise- your primary domain is someone else's secondary

### Example: Names
People use non-descriptive names for arguments
Put yurself in someone else's shoes when you name a method or argument to make it clear what it is you're doing. Make it easy for someone who looks at your pull request to get a general idea of what you're doing.

### Example: Comments
Comments are not for you. They're for others.
Veronica Hanus on comments: comments remind people what their code does and save time. 
Antirez describes 9 types of comments, worth a look.

### Example: Commit messages
Supposed to tell us why there was a change. 'Fix it' is not a good commit message- it makes people angry.
Should answer some questions 'Why did we need this change? What are the side effects? Links to JIRA or Trello issues? How does it achieve this goal?'

### Things to Avoid.
Strong opinions, loosely held. Maybe qualify with a percentage confidence?
If there's a problem just come talk to me- this is actually not a good strategy. You should document instead. People don't want to bother you. It implies there shouldn't be a problem. You will also forget.
Not fully using communication methods available. Easy to lose meaning over text. Don't forget to use phone, video chat, emojis, etc.
Templates backfire and are overused (JIRA tickets, security checklists, etc.)
